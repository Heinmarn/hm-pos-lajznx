Optimize for low memory usage and fast performance. Include sample menu items and test data. Prioritize performance and reliability on low-spec Android devices. By the way, Design a clean and professional POS interface using standard retail color schemes. Avoid neon or glowing effects. Use soft neutral backgrounds (light gray, white), readable fonts, and clear layout. Buttons should be flat and modern with subtle shadows. Use familiar colors like green for confirm, red for cancel, and blue for info. Icons should be minimal and intuitive. The overall style should resemble real-world POS systems used in restaurants or cafes. Prioritize clarity, usability, and fast interaction.

You want a POS (Point of Sale) system app named \"H.M POS\" for tea shops and restaurants in Myanmar, optimized for low-end Android devices. You've specified a comprehensive set of features, including menu management, order placement, kitchen sync, multi-device sync, payment options, sales reports, offline-first functionality, user roles, language toggle, and responsive layout. You also want to use Supabase for the backend and Expo for React Native development. Finally, you've provided detailed instructions for the UI design, opting for a clean and professional retail-style interface instead of the initial hacker-style dark mode.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Menu Management:** Implement the ability to add, edit, and delete menu items with name, price, and category. Include the sample menu items you provided (Wet salad, Mala Shan Kaut, Mala Mok Chauk, Cold drinks, and purified water).\n*   **Order Placement:** Create an interface for selecting items, specifying quantity and table number, and submitting orders.\n*   **Kitchen Sync:** Set up a basic mechanism for orders to appear on a designated \"kitchen device.\" We'll refine the local Wi-Fi sync later.\n*   **Payment Options:** Implement Cash, KBZPay, WavePay with QR code scanning.\n*   **Sales report:** Daily/weekly/monthly summaries with item breakdown.\n*   **User roles:** Admin, cashier, kitchen staff with login and access control.\n*   **Language toggle:** Burmese and English UI switch.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#4CAF50` (Green - for confirm actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#F44336` (Red - for cancel actions)\n    *   Accent: `#2196F3` (Blue - for info/actions)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E0E0E0` (Light Gray - for subtle highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use a clean, modern font like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for readability.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Enable Supabase:** Instruct the user to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project.\n2.  **Project Setup:** Set up the basic project structure with Expo.\n3.  **UI Implementation:**\n    *   Create the main screens (Menu Management, Order Placement, Kitchen View, Sales Report, User Management).\n    *   Implement the color scheme and typography.\n    *   Design the layout for phones and tablets, ensuring responsiveness.\n    *   Create the payment options screen.\n    *   Create the sales report screen.\n    *   Create the user roles screen.\n    *   Create the language toggle screen.\n4.  **Functionality Implementation:**\n    *   Implement menu management features (add, edit, delete items).\n    *   Implement order placement logic.\n    *   Implement kitchen sync functionality.\n    *   Implement payment options.\n    *   Implement sales report functionality.\n    *   Implement user roles functionality.\n    *   Implement language toggle functionality.\n5.  **Supabase Integration:**\n    *   Set up Supabase authentication for user roles.\n    *   Create a Supabase database schema for menu items, orders, sales data, and user information.\n    *   Implement data synchronization between the app and Supabase.\n6.  **Offline-First Implementation:**\n    *   Use local storage (e.g., AsyncStorage) to store data offline.\n    *   Implement synchronization logic to sync data with Supabase when online.\n7.  **Optimization:**\n    *   Optimize images and assets for low memory usage.\n    *   Use efficient data structures and algorithms.\n    *   Test the app on low-end Android devices and profile performance.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAlso, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T06:13:03.106607"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the H.M POS system app for tea shops and restaurants in Myanmar.
